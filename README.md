# thermal_simulation_of_Li-ion_Cells_for_Electric_Vehicles
 Thermal behavior of lithium-ion batteries plays a critical role in ensuring safe and efficient operation. This study presents a coupled modeling framework to investigate the thermal behavior of commercial 18650-format Lithium-Nickel-Cobalt-Aluminum Oxide and Lithium-Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt Oxide cells.
