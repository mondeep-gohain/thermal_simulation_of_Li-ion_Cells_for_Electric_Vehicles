# thermal_simulation_of_Li-ion_Cells_for_Electric_Vehicles
 Thermal behavior of lithium-ion batteries plays a critical role in ensuring safe and efficient operation. This study presents a coupled modeling framework to investigate the thermal behavior of commercial 18650-format Lithium-Nickel-Cobalt-Aluminum Oxide and Lithium-Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt Oxide cells.
Shepherdâ€™s voltage model was implemented in MATLAB to compute time-dependent heat generation rates per unit volume, accounting for both Joule and entropy contributions during various charging and discharging cycles. The resulting heat generation data were coupled with a three-dimensional finite volume simulation in ANSYS Fluent via a user-defined function (UDF) to obtain spatial and temporal temperature distributions. The results reveal temperature distributions within the cells, identifying the core as the primary hotspot.
Simulations were performed for single cells as well as multi-cell pack configurations (2S and 3S). Results show that NMC cells exhibit higher peak temperatures than NCA under identical conditions, with temperature rising more significantly during high C-rate charging. Multi-cell configurations further amplify the maximum temperature due to inter-cell thermal interactions. These findings provide insights into thermal management strategies for next-generation lithium-ion battery packs.
